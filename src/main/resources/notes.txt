    Before submitting this assignment, I checked how my program handled the unzipped 120GB file from:
    https://ecwid-vgv-storage.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ip_addresses.zip

    And now I'd like to share here some details about the program performance.

    During the program execution, I tracked how much memory was being used.
    Naturally, as the program continued, the memory usage grew.
    And here are the maximum usage values observed during the execution on average:
        * Heap -> 685 MB
        * MetaSpace -> 467 MB
        * TOTAL -> 1,2 GB

    Please see the results in "src/main/resources/memory_usage.png" file.

    Regarding the execution time, the program on average takes about 6 minutes and 15 seconds on my machine.
    Here are my machine specifications:
         * RAM -> 16 GB
         * Processor -> 13th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1360P × 16
